### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**cloudaura207/cloudaura207** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting grips with everything, imagine me like a child who messes up a lot but still expects to be saved when things go tits up.  
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cybersecurity, cloud computing and web.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything you have time for. I am a copywriter and UX writer by trade.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding, security, life the universe and everything to which the answer is 42.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about literally anything I love typing.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: @supercalz or @wordsbycallum on instagram, 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He, Him, His
- âš¡ Fun fact: Psychosis brought me into this world whether I liked it or not, with every new skill, I get a little more sane â€” you would be doing me a big favour!
